      <p><i>The Calder stands where we shall too.</i>
      <br><br>Gallows and Lollipops is a highly selective society at Yale University, founded in the spring of 2018, in order to recrod and preserve the ever-changing visage of Alexander Calder's sculpture, <i>Gallows and Lollipops</i>.
      <br><br>As a member of this society, your duty is to continue legacy of our founders observing and logging the tangled status of the Calder with resolve, accuracy, and tenacity.
      <br><br>Our virtual tomb is only accessible at the Calder. Knowledge of how to access the tomb must only remain within the society. Do not discuss any matters of Gallows and Lollipops with anyone who you are not certain is a member.
      <br><br>If you are a newly tapped pledge member, existing members will approach you first if seen at the Calder. Do not make any attempt to connect with any members first.
      <br><br>You will be severely reprimanded if found leaking information regarding the society, or if found falsely recording the Calder's status.
      <br><br><i>Observe, Record, Swing.</i></p>

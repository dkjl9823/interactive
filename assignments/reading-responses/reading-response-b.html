    <p><b>Ayham</b> Do students feel more empowered with the Yale wiki versus staff using the Whitney’s website? I guess we could ask everyone: Is there something about the site that makes you inclined to contribute and change it?</p>
    <p><b>Micah Barrett</b> When I was looking at it a while ago, I was noticing some patterns with subtle little GIFs. Specifically the background image module. Some of them are pretty direct and obvious, like the background on the calendar page. Then I found myself really enjoying the financial aid background image, which is this really bizarre contraption GIF. You’re moving through the site. I was starting to read it in a slightly different way which was really exciting.
    <p><b>Ayham</b> You felt like there was some sort of meaning in someone putting that GIF on the financial aid page?</p>
    <p><b>Micah</b> Yeah, exactly.</p>
    <p><b>Micah</b> A current student was leaving a secret message for me as a prospective student. I don’t even remember what it was, but it was in either class listing in the background or the classroom page, someone put a really disgusted face. I was like, “Oh, is this a message? Should I be worried about this class?” That was enjoyable.</p>
    <p><i><b>Daniel</b> I think undergrads undergo a similar experience with the site. We occupy a position that isn't quite an 'active member' of the site – since we don't have access – but we're not quite 'prospective students' either. We also have a unique over-the-shoulder look into the inner workings of art.yale.edu, too, through our involvement with the school. Reading into the gifs is something undergrads do often. I have a friend who thinks the dancing cartoon bird gif on the undergraduate page is infantilizing. I think it's kind of an apt portrayal of us. For us, I think there's always a tension between being a casual onlooker and wanting in on the 'fun' of the site. There's this sense of exclusivity to the wiki that I think is crucial to realizing the intent of the design? To be honest, I'm just learning so much about the site today.</i>

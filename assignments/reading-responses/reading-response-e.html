    <p><b>Response</b> As much as I enjoyed the other two readings, Paul Ford's article on decentralizing the internet, for some reason, has stuck with me the most â€“ especially his concluding paragraph. There's something strangely poetic in the idea of moving away from a centralized internet (I've been thinking a lot about poetry an the internet and where their similarities and differences lie, especially while working on my CSS Typeface project), as if it could be a metaphor for going against the grain, going back to something more primitive (albeit, still wildly technologically advanced), an escapade, a possibility for lost intimacy or privacy. It also feels dytopian and Orwellian to ruminate on living in a world where my personal information is so readily available because I unknowingly but willingly make it that way. I think this gives me a good start to thinking about the local website project and creating a site that is only accessible by me or a small group of people in a specific location.</p>
    <p><b>Discussion question</b> Does a decentralized internet appeal to you? Is it somewhat poetic, or is that just me?</p>

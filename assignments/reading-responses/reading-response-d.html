    <p>Readings for Project 1. <b>CSS Typeface</b></p>

    <p>Tauba Auerbach <b>P-E-R-S-E-V-E-R-E</b><br>
    Donald Knuth <b>The Concept of a Meta-Font</b><br>
    <i>and</i> Paul Chan <b>FAQ on Alternumerics</b></p>

    <p><b>Response</b> The variety of exploration of typography across the three texts is inspiring to me. From the meditative calligraphy of Auerbach, to the near-infinite possibilities of the meta-font, to the subversive nature of Chan's <i>Alternumerics</i>, for someone who has never designed a typeface before, the readings offer a variety of starting points and processes. It does, however, seem a daunting task to undetake any of the three. Perseverenace, computing knowledge, and a sense of wit are required for the three processes, respectively, and I'm both excited and intimidated by that.
    <br> Beyond the project at hand, I'm interested in the repeatability of each of these process, and how they all seem to work within a system: a personalized system of practice, a set of coded instructions, and a font that computes alphanumerics to other stand-ins. The typeface as a piece of art also supplies its own medium that lends itself to the possibility of further production of art â€“ the font. The idea of something being a finalized porudct but also the starting point of a new product is exciting to me. I wanted to find an analogy for the typeface and the font, like a painting and paint, but since the two constantly reference each other, I couldn't find something apt (the painting references the paint used, but paint does not reference the painting that used it). I hope we might be able to find one in discussion.</p>
    <p><b>Discussion question</b> What would be an adequate analogy for the relationship between a typeface and a font?</p>

  <h2>The Process: Preface</h2>
  <p>Our team of professionals interact with the Cosmos around us to find and offer you, our customers, the best quality, most powerful names in the universe. Revealing our process would be business suicide, but a simplified version can be found below. We have listed our procedure to ensure that our practice is valid. That said, we will legally pursue any individual(s) attempting to mimic our practice for monetary purposes without our concent. Contact process@cosmicbabynames.com for business inquiries.</p>

  <h2>The Process</h2>
  <ul class="process">
    <li><h3>Sanitation</h3>We first clenase ourselves, both physically and mentally in preparation for the name-finding ceremony. Any impurities of the body or mind will interfere with cosmis interaction.</li>
    <li><h3>Attire</h3>We dress ourselves in the highest quality silks, hand-made by artisans, traditionally trained in the mountains of South East and East Asia. Clothes are worn 3 times, and then deemed impure and burned.</li>
    <li><h3>Slumber</h3>We then must fall into a deep but conscious sleep, akin to lucid dreaming. We heighten our consciousness through the use of several rare incenses.</li>
    <li><h3>Contact</h3>The Cosmos and Higher Beings contact us in our dream-like state. Words speak out to us through our five senses. Sometime we may feel it in our hand, or taste it on our tongue. The more potent the name, the more powerful the sensory experience.</li>
    <li><h3>Recording</h3>Once we awake from our slumber, we record the name given to us in the session. Not all sessions yield valuable names.</li>
    <li><h3>Sale</h3>The names then go through a selection process to be sold on our site. Some names are not listed on the site but may be offered to specific customers if the Cosmos compels us to do so.</li>
    <li><h3>Thanksgiving</h3>Once a name has been successfully found, recorded, and sold, we give thanks to the Cosmos and Higher Beings. This happens in the form of ritualized song and dance.</li>

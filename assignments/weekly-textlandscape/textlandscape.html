    <p>You say to the boy open your eyes</p>
    <p>You make him cry out. Saying:</p>
    <p>O <span class="blue">BLUE</span> come forth</p>
    <p>O <span class="blue">BLUE</span> arise</p>
    <p>O <span class="blue">BLUE</span> ascend</p>
    <p>O <span class="blue">BLUE</span> come in</p>
    <p>I am sitting with some friends in this cafe drinking coffee served by young refugees from <span class="blue">B</span>osnia. The war rages across the newspapers and through the ruined streets of Sarajevo.</p>
    <p>Tania said 'Your c<span class="blue">l</span>othes are on back to front and inside o<span class="blue">u</span>t". Sinc<span class="blue">e</span> there were only two of us there I took them off and put them right then and there. I am always here <span class="blue">b</span>efore the doors open.</p>
    <p>What need of so much news from abroad whi<span class="blue">l</span>e all that concerns either life or death is all transacting and at work within me.</p>
    <p>I step off the c<span class="blue">u</span>rb and a cyclist n<span class="blue">e</span>arly knocks me down. Flying in from the dark he nearly parted my hair.</p>
    <p>I step into a <span class="blue">BLUE</span> funk.</p>
    <p>The doctor in St. <span class="blue">B</span>artho<span class="blue">l</span>omew's Hospital tho<span class="blue">u</span>ght h<span class="blue">e</span> could detect lesions in my retina - the pupils dilated with belladonna - the torch shone into them with a terrible blinding light.</p>
    <p>Look left</p>
    <p>Look down</p>
    <p>Look up</p>
    <p>Look right</p>
    <p><span class="blue">BLUE</span> flashes in my eyes.</p>
    <p><span class="blue">BLUE</span> <span class="blue">B</span>ott<span class="blue">l</span>e b<span class="blue">u</span>zzing</p>
    <p>Lazy days</p>
    <p>The sky <span class="blue">BLUE</span> butt<span class="blue">e</span>rfly</p>
    <p>Sways on the cornflower</p>
    <p>Lost in the warmth</p>
    <p>Of the <span class="blue">BLUE</span> heat haze</p>
    <p>Singing the <span class="blue">BLUE</span>s</p>
    <p>Quiet and slowly</p>
    <p><span class="blue">BLUE</span> of my heart</p>
    <p><span class="blue">BLUE</span> of my dreams</p>
    <p>Slow <span class="blue">BLUE</span> love</p>
    <p>Of delphinium days</p>
    <p><span class="blue">BLUE</span> is the universal love in which man <span class="blue">b</span>athes - it is the terrestria<span class="blue">l</span> paradise.</p>
    <p>I'm walking along the beach in a howling gale -</p>
    <p>Another year is passing</p>
    <p>In the roaring waters</p>
    <p>I hear the voices of dead friends</p>
    <p>Love is life that lasts forever.</p>
    <p>My hearts memory t<span class="blue">u</span>rns to you</p>
    <p>David. Howard. Graham. T<span class="blue">e</span>rry. Paul....</p>
    <p><span class="blue">B</span>ut what if this present</p>
    <p>Were the wor<span class="blue">l</span>d's last night</p>
    <p>In the setting s<span class="blue">u</span>n your lov<span class="blue">e</span> fades</p>
    <p>Dies in the moonlight</p>
    <p>Fails to rise</p>
    <p>Thrice denied by cock crow</p>
    <p>In the dawn's first light</p>
    <p>Look left</p>
    <p>Look down</p>
    <p>Look up</p>
    <p>Look right</p>
    <p>The camera flash</p>
    <p>Atomic <span class="blue">b</span>right</p>
    <p>Photos</p>
    <p>The CMV - a green moon then the wor<span class="blue">l</span>d t<span class="blue">u</span>rns mag<span class="blue">e</span>nta</p>
    <p>My retina</p>
    <p>Is a distant planet</p>
    <p>A red Mars</p>
    <p>From a <span class="blue">B</span>oy's Own comic</p>
    <p>With ye<span class="blue">l</span>low infection</p>
    <p>B<span class="blue">u</span>bbling at the corn<span class="blue">e</span>r</p>
    <p>I said this looks like a planet</p>
    <p>The doctor says - "Oh, I think</p>
    <p>It looks like a pizza"</p>
    <p>The worst of the illness is uncertainty. I've played this scenario <span class="blue">b</span>ack and forth each hour of the day for the <span class="blue">l</span>ast six years.</p>
    <p><span class="blue">BLUE</span> transcends the solemn geography of h<span class="blue">u</span>man limits.</p>
    <p>I am hom<span class="blue">e</span> with the <span class="blue">bl</span>inds drawn</p>
    <p>H.B. is back from Newcastle</p>
    <p>B<span class="blue">u</span>t gon<span class="blue">e</span> out - the washing</p>
    <p>Machine is roaring away</p>
    <p>And the fridge is defrosting</p>
    <p>These are his favourite sounds</p>
    <p>I've <span class="blue">b</span>een given the option of being an in-patient at the hospita<span class="blue">l</span> or to coming in twice a day to be hooked to a drip. My vision will never come back.</p>
    <p>The retina is destroyed, tho<span class="blue">u</span>gh wh<span class="blue">e</span>n the <span class="blue">bl</span>eeding stops what is left of my sight might improve. I have to come to terms with sightlessness.</p>
    <p>If I loose my sight will my vision be halved?</p>
    <p>The vir<span class="blue">u</span>s rag<span class="blue">e</span>s fierce. I have no friends now who are not dead or dying. Like a <span class="blue">BLUE</span> frost it caught them. At work, at the cinema, on marches and <span class="blue">b</span>eaches. In churches on their knees, running, f<span class="blue">l</span>ying, silent or sho<span class="blue">u</span>ting prot<span class="blue">e</span>st.</p>
    <p>It started with sweats in the night and swollen glands. Then the <span class="blue">bl</span>ack cancer spread across their faces - as they fo<span class="blue">u</span>ght for br<span class="blue">e</span>ath T<span class="blue">B</span> and pneumonia hammered their <span class="blue">lu</span>ngs, and Toxo at the brain. R<span class="blue">e</span>flexes scram<span class="blue">bl</span>ed -
      sweat po<span class="blue">u</span>r<span class="blue">e</span>d through hair matter like lianas in the tropical forest. Voices slurred - and then were lost forever. My pen chased this story across the page tossed this way and that in the storm.</p>
    <p>The <span class="blue">bl</span>ood of sensibility is <span class="blue">BLUE</span></p>
    <p>I consecrate myself</p>
    <p>To find its most perfect expression</p>
    <p>My sight failed a little more in the night</p>
    <p>H.B. offers me his blood</p>
    <p>It will kill everything he says</p>
    <p>The drip of DHPG</p>
    <p>Trills like a canary</p>
    <p>I am accompanied by a shadow into which H.B. appears and disappears. I have lost the sight on the periphery of my right eye.</p>
    <p>I hold out my hands before me and slowly part them. At a certain moment they disappear o<span class="blue">u</span>t of th<span class="blue">e</span> corner of my eyes. This is how I used to see. Now if I repeat the motion this is all I see.</p>
    <p>I shall not win the <span class="blue">b</span>att<span class="blue">l</span>e against the vir<span class="blue">u</span>s - in spit<span class="blue">e</span> of the slogans like "Living with AIDS". The virus was appropriated by the well - so we have to live with AIDS while they spread the quilt for the moths of Ithaca across the wine dark sea.</p>
    <p>Awareness is heightened by this, but something else is lost. A sense of reality drowned in theatre.</p>
    <p>Thinking blind, becoming blind.</p>

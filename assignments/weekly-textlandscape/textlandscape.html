    <p>You say to the boy open your eyes</p>
    <p>You make him cry out. Saying</p>
    <p>O <span class="blue">Blue</span> come forth</p>
    <p>O <span class="blue">Blue</span> arise</p>
    <p>O <span class="blue">Blue</span> ascend</p>
    <p>O <span class="blue">Blue</span> come in</p>
    <p>I am sitting with some friends in this cafe drinking coffee served by young refugees from Bosnia. The war rages across the newspapers and through the ruined streets of Sarajevo.</p>
    <p>Tania said 'Your clothes are on back to front and inside out". Since there were only two of us there I took them off and put them right then and there. I am always here before the doors open.</p>
    <p>What need of so much news from abroad while all that concerns either life or death is all transacting and at work within me.</p>
    <p>I step off the kerb and a cyclist nearly knocks me down. Flying in from the dark he nearly parted my hair.</p>
    <p>I step into a <span class="blue">Blue</span> funk.</p>
    <p>The doctor in St. Bartholomew's Hospital thought he could detect lesions in my retina - the pupils dilated with belladonna - the torch shone into them with a terrible blinding light.</p>
    <p>Look left</p>
    <p>Look down</p>
    <p>Look up</p>
    <p>Look right</p>
    <p><span class="blue">Blue</span> flashes in my eyes.</p>
    <p><span class="blue">Blue</span> Bottle buzzing</p>
    <p>Lazy days</p>
    <p>The sky <span class="blue">Blue</span> butterfly</p>
    <p>Sways on the cornflower</p>
    <p>Lost in the warmth</p>
    <p>Of the <span class="blue">Blue</span> heat haze</p>
    <p>Singing the <span class="blue">Blue</span>s</p>
    <p>Quiet and slowly</p>
    <p><span class="blue">Blue</span> of my heart</p>
    <p><span class="blue">Blue</span> of my dreams</p>
    <p>Slow <span class="blue">Blue</span> love</p>
    <p>Of delphinium days</p>
    <p><span class="blue">Blue</span> is the universal love in which man bathes - it is the terrestrial paradise.</p>
    <p>I'm walking along the beach in a howling gale -</p>
    <p>Another year is passing</p>
    <p>In the roaring waters</p>
    <p>I hear the voices of dead friends</p>
    <p>Love is life that lasts forever.</p>
    <p>My hearts memory turns to you</p>
    <p>David. Howard. Graham. Terry. Paul....</p>
    <p>But what if this present</p>
    <p>Were the world's last night</p>
    <p>In the setting sun your love fades</p>
    <p>Dies in the moonlight</p>
    <p>Fails to rise</p>
    <p>Thrice denied by cock crow</p>
    <p>In the dawn's first light</p>
    <p>Look left</p>
    <p>Look down</p>
    <p>Look up</p>
    <p>Look right</p>
    <p>The camera flash</p>
    <p>Atomic bright</p>
    <p>Photos</p>
    <p>The CMV - a green moon then the world turns magenta</p>
    <p>My retina</p>
    <p>Is a distant planet</p>
    <p>A red Mars</p>
    <p>From a Boy's Own comic</p>
    <p>With yellow infection</p>
    <p>Bubbling at the corner</p>
    <p>I said this looks like a planet</p>
    <p>The doctor says - "Oh, I think</p>
    <p>It looks like a pizza"</p>
    <p>The worst of the illness is uncertainty. I've played this scenario back and forth each hour of the day for the last six years.</p>
    <p><span class="blue">Blue</span> transcends the solemn geography of human limits.</p>
    <p>I am home with the blinds drawn</p>
    <p>H.B. is back from Newcastle</p>
    <p>But gone out - the washing</p>
    <p>Machine is roaring away</p>
    <p>And the fridge is defrosting</p>
    <p>These are his favourite sounds</p>
    <p>I've been given the option of being an in-patient at the hospital or to coming in twice a day to be hooked to a drip. My vision will never come back.</p>
    <p>The retina is destroyed, though when the bleeding stops what is left of my sight might improve. I have to come to terms with sightlessness.</p>
    <p>If I loose my sight will my vision be halved?</p>
    <p>The virus rages fierce. I have no friends now who are not dead or dying. Like a <span class="blue">Blue</span> frost it caught them. At work, at the cinema, on marches and beaches. In churches on their knees, running, flying, silent or shouting protest.</p>
    <p>It started with sweats in the night and swollen glands. Then the black cancer spread across their faces - as they fought for breath TB and pneumonia hammered their lungs, and Toxo at the brain. Reflexes scrambled - sweat poured through hair matter like lianas in the tropical forest. Voices slurred - and then were lost forever. My pen chased this story across the page tossed this way and that in the storm.</p>
    <p>The blood of sensibility is <span class="blue">Blue</span></p>
    <p>I consecrate myself</p>
    <p>To find its most perfect expression</p>
    <p>My sight failed a little more in the night</p>
    <p>H.B. offers me his blood</p>
    <p>It will kill everything he says</p>
    <p>The drip of DHPG</p>
    <p>Trills like a canary</p>
    <p>I am accompanied by a shadow into which H.B. appears and disappears. I have lost the sight on the periphery of my right eye.</p>
    <p>I hold out my hands before me and slowly part them. At a certain moment they disappear out of the corner of my eyes. This is how I used to see. Now if I repeat the motion this is all I see.</p>
    <p>I shall not win the battle against the virus - in spite of the slogans like "Living with AIDS". The virus was appropriated by the well - so we have to live with AIDS while they spread the quilt for the moths of Ithaca across the wine dark sea.</p>
    <p>Awareness is heightened by this, but something else is lost. A sense of reality drowned in theatre.</p>
    <p>Thinking blind, becoming blind.</p>
